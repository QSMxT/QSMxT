We developed an open-source QSM processing framework, QSMxT, that provides a full QSM workflow including converting DICOM data to BIDS, a variety of robust masking strategies, phase unwrapping, background field correction, dipole inversion and region-of-interest analyses based on automated anatomical segmentations. We make all required external dependencies available in a reproducible and scalable analysis environment enabling users to process QSM data for large groups of participants on any operating system in a robust way.
